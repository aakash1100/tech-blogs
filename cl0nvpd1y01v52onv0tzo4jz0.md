## My 10 frequently used VI Editor keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are essential for quick execution of necessary actions while working with SSH. Initially, it is very difficult to remember these shortcuts and get used to with them but as soon as you make habit of using them, you will start feeling the super power!

This blog is about my frequently used keyboard shortcuts of VI editor. 

1. **`SHIFT` + `g`** Go to last line in the file
2. **`d` + `d`** Delete line (*where cursor is placed*)
3.  **`:q!`** Forcefully quit without saving the file (`:wq!` to write and quit forcefully)
4. **`/<type-text-to-search>`** and **`?<type-text-to-search>`** to search forward and backward respectively (*to repeat the search we can press **`n`** or **`N`** for forward and backword direction respectively*)
5. **`:r<file-path>`** Insert content of other file in current file
6. **`w`** and **`b`** to move one word forward and backward in line respectively
7. **`:set number`** and **`:set nonumber`** to see or hide line numbers
8. **`:<line-number>`** jump to specific line 
9.  **`^`** and **`$`** go to beginning and end of the line respectively
10. **`i`** enables insert just before the cursor position (**`ESC`** to get out of the input mode)

(*You may already know that these shortcuts do not work in input mode as it will be considered as a text to input in file.* )
